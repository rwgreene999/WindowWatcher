# WindowWatcher

Get your attention when you have unnoticed Skype messages. 

## Justification

Have you ever been ending your business day, closing windows, only to notice that you boss skyped you 3 hours earlier and the chat window ws behind your windows on the second monitor??

I have, and it was embarrassing :(

## Solution

This program provides several options to get your attention about outstanding lync or Skype Business. 

This was last run on Windows 7 with the most recent Skype for Business in 2017, if you configured Skype to open seperate windows for each conversation. 

_it does not work with Skype home on Windows 10 because Microsoft decided to use the Action Center and I have not had time to look into this as a solution option as of yet_

## Possible Roadmap

-   Add support Skype personal in Windows 10 Action Center Notifications
-   Maybe support for other chat processes, like Hangouts
